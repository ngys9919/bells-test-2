# Project Guide
For the purpose of the portfolio project, a landing page is created for the following:

```json
{
1. "CRUD Application" : in our case "Library Management System"
}
```

This project is about a simple *Library Management System (LMS)* at **BELLSTECH** using the concepts we learned in the Todo List application lab. Instead of managing tasks, we'll be managing books in a library.

C = Create: adding new data to the database
R = Read: get existing information
U = Update: update existing information in the database
D = Delete: remove existing information from the database

books[] -> represent our database model
- array: represents the entire database
- object: represents one record

The application of this project caters to the needs of a specific target user group, the mid-career switchers,
who are looking for information on SCTP Courses at BELLSTECH, a tech business unit of [Bells Institute of Higher Learning][1].

The website provides an one-stop entry point to the library books available and its borrowed status, namely:

***
1. *ISBN*
2. *Title*
3. *Author*
4. *isCheckedOut*
***
